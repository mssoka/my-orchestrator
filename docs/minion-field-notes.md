# Minion field notes (curated)

**Read at the START of every minion job** (standing orders). Lessons from
previous minions — tooling traps, conventions that saved time, review
findings that keep recurring. One line per entry, dated, with the job id.

## How this file works (shard-by-writer — no locks, ever)

- **Minions write ONLY their own shard:**
  `_bmad-output/field-notes/<job-id>.md` — ≤3 one-liners at badge-out
  (what bit you, what future minions must know). Never edit this file,
  never another minion's shard. Mega-minion lessons roll up through the
  parent minion, not through their own files.
- **Gru is the only writer here** — consolidation duty: read shards,
  promote durable lessons into this file, prune what's stale.
- Writers never sharing a file is the whole concurrency design. See
  README.md § Memory.

## Tooling traps

- 2026-07-29 (righttenantry-refcheck-v1-architecture): lavish HTML builds
  via piped subprocess stdout (`marked` etc.) TRUNCATE at ~85KB
  (pipe-buffer). Build via a file write, then verify byte length + tail
  section before serving. Caught only after the user reviewed a truncated
  page.
- 2026-07-29 (refcheck crew): `npx -y lavish-axi <file>` opens the user's
  browser itself — no URL to relay. One foreground poll per session; if
  killed, re-run (queued feedback is never lost); `end` your own session,
  NEVER `lavish-axi stop` (shared server, port 4387).
