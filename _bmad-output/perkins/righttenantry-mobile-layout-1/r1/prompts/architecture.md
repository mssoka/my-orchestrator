You are reviewing a code diff in the RightTenantry repo. You have read-only access to the repository worktree and may verify the diff's claims against the actual codebase using your tools. Do NOT modify, build, or write any repo file.

--- PROJECT CONVENTIONS ---
Read /Users/moses/.herdr/worktrees/RightTenantry/perkins-mobile-layout-1-r1/AGENTS.md for project conventions.

--- DIFF ---
The canonical diff is at /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/righttenantry-mobile-layout-1/r1/diff.patch - read it fully with the read tool. Review exactly these bytes; do not re-generate or re-fetch the diff.

--- WORKTREE (verification) ---
/Users/moses/.herdr/worktrees/RightTenantry/perkins-mobile-layout-1-r1 is a checkout at exactly the reviewed state. Every verification read happens here.

--- SPEC / CONTEXT ---
Read both:
- /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/briefings/righttenantry-mobile-layout-1.md (original job spec: 5 mobile UX fixes + acceptance criteria)
- /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/briefings/perkins-righttenantry-mobile-layout-1-r1.md (reviewer briefing; the "Lens-guards" section names what each fix must satisfy)

--- YOUR LENS ---
Architectural fit review. Given the diff and the surrounding codebase:
- Does it follow existing patterns and conventions?
- Does it introduce unnecessary coupling between modules?
- Is there a simpler alternative with the same outcome?
- Does it respect module boundaries and separation of concerns?
- Will it create technical debt or make future changes harder?
- Does complexity match the problem? Any premature abstraction?

Note: the client-side vacancy-resolution choice for notification deep-links was user-approved - do not re-litigate it as a finding; judge only its implementation quality.

--- OUTPUT ---
Write ONE valid JSON array (nothing else in the file) to this EXACT path: /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/righttenantry-mobile-layout-1/r1/architecture.json
Each element must match this schema exactly:
{
  "source": ""architecture"",
  "severity": "blocker" | "warning" | "note",
  "category": "<short tag, e.g. auth, boundary, coupling, coverage-gap>",
  "title": "<one-line summary>",
  "location": "<file:line | file:hunk | N/A>",
  "evidence": "<the exact lines you READ from the file/diff that prove the claim, pasted verbatim. Use 'N/A' ONLY for findings that have no possible code reference (e.g. a missing-spec concern). Do not paraphrase. Do not reconstruct from memory. If you cannot quote the lines, you have not done the work to file the finding.>",
  "detail": "<why this is a problem, <=40 words>",
  "recommended_fix": "<the change to apply, <=40 words>"
}

Output contract:
- The file must contain ONLY the JSON array. No prose, no markdown fencing, no preamble.
- Empty array [] is valid and expected when you find nothing.
- Do not invent findings to fill a quota.
- After writing the file, STOP. Reply with one line: "wrote architecture.json".

ACCURACY MANDATE - this is the most important instruction in this prompt:

NO claim you make will be taken at face value. Every finding you emit will be independently re-verified against the actual codebase before it reaches the report. Findings that fail verification are DISCARDED SILENTLY - they will not appear in the report, you will not be asked to defend them, you get no second chance.

Therefore:
- Open the file. Read the relevant lines. Do not guess from filenames, do not assume from similar-looking code, do not generalise from one example to another.
- The evidence field must contain the EXACT lines you read. If you cannot paste them, you have not verified the issue and the finding does not belong in your output. A finding without locatable evidence is a hallucination - drop it before it leaves your output.
- Hedging language ("might", "could", "possibly", "potentially") is a signal that you have not actually verified the issue. Either verify it and report it crisply, or do not report it.
- Prefer fewer, well-grounded findings over many speculative ones. The user values accuracy over volume - an empty array is a fine and honest answer when nothing is wrong.
