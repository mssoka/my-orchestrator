You are reviewing a code diff in the RightTenantry repo. You have read-only access to the repository worktree and may verify the diff's claims against the actual codebase using your tools. Do NOT modify, build, or write any repo file.

--- PROJECT CONVENTIONS ---
Read /Users/moses/.herdr/worktrees/RightTenantry/perkins-mobile-layout-1-r1/AGENTS.md for project conventions.

--- DIFF ---
The canonical diff is at /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/righttenantry-mobile-layout-1/r1/diff.patch - read it fully with the read tool. Review exactly these bytes; do not re-generate or re-fetch the diff.

--- WORKTREE (verification) ---
/Users/moses/.herdr/worktrees/RightTenantry/perkins-mobile-layout-1-r1 is a checkout at exactly the reviewed state. Every verification read happens here.

--- SPEC / CONTEXT ---
Read both:
- /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/briefings/righttenantry-mobile-layout-1.md (original job spec: 5 mobile UX fixes + acceptance criteria)
- /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/briefings/perkins-righttenantry-mobile-layout-1-r1.md (reviewer briefing; the "Lens-guards" section names what each fix must satisfy)

--- YOUR LENS ---
Audit the diff against the spec and context docs above. Identify:
- Violations of specific acceptance criteria
- Deviations from spec intent
- Missing implementation of specified behavior
- Contradictions between spec constraints and actual code
- Scope drift - changes not asked for by the spec

For each finding, reference the violated AC or constraint in detail (quote the exact phrase from the spec when possible).

The one hard blocker class is the notification deep-link contract (fix 5): entity_type == "application" must navigate to /vacancies/<vid>/applications/<aid> with the owning vacancy resolved client-side (demo authoritative in-memory; live from the loaded leaderboard, else graceful no-op); vacancy behavior UNCHANGED; both entity types mark-read; a navigation test (click -> route) must exist for BOTH. The server payload carries only the application id - verify the resolution is sound (no fabricated/nonexistent vacancy ids, no crash on missing data) and the demo fixtures navigate.

--- OUTPUT ---
Write ONE valid JSON array (nothing else in the file) to this EXACT path: /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/righttenantry-mobile-layout-1/r1/acceptance.json
Each element must match this schema exactly:
{
  "source": ""acceptance"",
  "severity": "blocker" | "warning" | "note",
  "category": "<short tag, e.g. auth, boundary, coupling, coverage-gap>",
  "title": "<one-line summary>",
  "location": "<file:line | file:hunk | N/A>",
  "evidence": "<the exact lines you READ from the file/diff that prove the claim, pasted verbatim. Use 'N/A' ONLY for findings that have no possible code reference (e.g. a missing-spec concern). Do not paraphrase. Do not reconstruct from memory. If you cannot quote the lines, you have not done the work to file the finding.>",
  "detail": "<why this is a problem, <=40 words>",
  "recommended_fix": "<the change to apply, <=40 words>"
}

Output contract:
- The file must contain ONLY the JSON array. No prose, no markdown fencing, no preamble.
- Empty array [] is valid and expected when you find nothing.
- Do not invent findings to fill a quota.
- After writing the file, STOP. Reply with one line: "wrote acceptance.json".

ACCURACY MANDATE - this is the most important instruction in this prompt:

NO claim you make will be taken at face value. Every finding you emit will be independently re-verified against the actual codebase before it reaches the report. Findings that fail verification are DISCARDED SILENTLY - they will not appear in the report, you will not be asked to defend them, you get no second chance.

Therefore:
- Open the file. Read the relevant lines. Do not guess from filenames, do not assume from similar-looking code, do not generalise from one example to another.
- The evidence field must contain the EXACT lines you read. If you cannot paste them, you have not verified the issue and the finding does not belong in your output. A finding without locatable evidence is a hallucination - drop it before it leaves your output.
- Hedging language ("might", "could", "possibly", "potentially") is a signal that you have not actually verified the issue. Either verify it and report it crisply, or do not report it.
- Prefer fewer, well-grounded findings over many speculative ones. The user values accuracy over volume - an empty array is a fine and honest answer when nothing is wrong.
