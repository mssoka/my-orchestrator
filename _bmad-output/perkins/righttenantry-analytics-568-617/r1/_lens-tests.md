# Lens: Test Coverage (source: `tests`)

Read your shared context first: /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/righttenantry-analytics-568-617/r1/_shared.md — it defines your inputs, the round-specific guards, the output schema, and the accuracy mandate. Your assigned `source` value is `tests`. Your output path is: /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/righttenantry-analytics-568-617/r1/tests.json

Test coverage analysis via traceability.

For each behaviour change in the diff, trace to a test (new in the diff, or existing). Classify as FULL / PARTIAL / NONE coverage. Emit one finding per gap with severity:
- blocker: P0 gap (critical path, happy + core error) OR P1 coverage <80%
- warning: P1 gap at 80–89% OR P2 gap
- note: P3 gap

Blind-spot heuristics to check:
- New/modified API endpoints without matching coverage
- Auth/authz paths missing negative tests
- Happy-path-only coverage where error handling is implied
- New DB operations without integration coverage
- New state transitions without boundary tests

The behaviour changes in this diff include: first-touch params riding the OAuth initiate URL; the signed first-touch cookie (set/read/clear, clamping, tamper rejection, organic-landing omission); the `provider=google` `$set_once` fallback; Meta CAPI CompleteRegistration on OAuth insert (consent-gated, insert-only); the two auto-create log-line changes; the client-side query-string serialization.

Test level mix (unit/integration/E2E): flag mismatches as findings.

Finally, emit ONE additional finding representing the advisory gate:
- title: "Advisory test gate: PASS" | "...CONCERNS" | "...FAIL"
- category: "coverage-gate"
- severity: PASS → note, CONCERNS → warning, FAIL → blocker
- detail: rationale with coverage percentages
- recommended_fix: what would raise the gate

Gate thresholds:
- PASS: P0 100%, P1 ≥90%, overall ≥80%
- CONCERNS: P0 100%, P1 80–89%, overall ≥80%
- FAIL: P0 <100%, or P1 <80%, or overall <80%
