You are reviewing a code diff. You have read-only access to the repository and may verify the diff's claims against the actual codebase using your available tools. Your cwd IS the reviewed worktree.

--- PROJECT CONVENTIONS ---
Read AGENTS.md at the repository root. It is the project's agent contract: C++-first (Blueprints only where unavoidable, documented); determinism spine discipline — all state-affecting sim math is integer (ODN-10), the sim owns its PRNG (PP::FRng, ODN-9; never FMath::Rand/FRandomStream in sim state paths), no TMap/TSet iteration in sim state paths, serialization is explicit little-endian field-by-field (ODN-11, never raw memcpy of structs), every spine change re-runs tests/build/spine-check + the UE-side PacketPlumber.* automation tests, replay-equality (same seed+action log → byte-identical state hash); fixed 20 Hz tick (ODN-2); golden discipline (never re-bless to dodge a mismatch); CI has engine-free gates (format/spine/static — must be green now) and engine-gated gates (build/headless/probe/golden — activate when UE 5.8 is installed; the engine is NOT installed yet, that is a documented manual user step, NOT a defect).

--- DIFF ---
The canonical diff is saved at /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-ue-bootstrap/r1/diff.patch (unified diff, 46 files, 2872 diff lines — the PR is a NEW repo, so all files are additions). Read it from that exact file. These are the exact bytes under review; never regenerate or re-fetch the diff.

--- SPEC / CONTEXT ---
Read these spec documents, in order:
1. /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/briefings/packet-plumber-ue-bootstrap.md — the original job briefing (mission, deliverables, acceptance, canon: the Odin GDD + routing canon [RR] + determinism rules [ODN-*] carry over as requirements; do NOT re-decide design).
2. /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/briefings/perkins-packet-plumber-ue-bootstrap-r1.md — the review briefing (r1 lens-guards: the ONE hard blocker class — the determinism spine port must be carried as REQUIREMENTS — what to verify, what NOT to re-litigate: the user's 4 lavish rulings, the game design, the engine choice).
3. /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-ue-bootstrap/r1/pr.json — PR title/body (the "Decisions & rationale" D1–D5 and the staged engine-gated acceptance items).

--- YOUR LENS ---
Reality check against the actual codebase. Verify by reading files, not by assuming:
- Do files, functions, types, and imports referenced in the diff actually exist and match?
- Are naming conventions and style consistent with the rest of the project?
- Does the diff duplicate logic that already exists elsewhere? (Point to the existing helper in `location`.)
- Are new dependencies (imports, packages) available, or do they need adding?
- Are there existing tests this diff likely breaks? (Name them in `location`.)
- Does it leave orphan code — functions, exports, types no longer referenced after this change?

Cross-checks worth doing: do the Build.cs module dependency lists match what the code actually includes? Do the scripts reference files that exist (tests/build/spine-check, docs/goldens/*)? Do docs/AGENTS.md commands match the actual scripts? Does the engine-free gate set actually run green at this sha (you may run scripts/local-ci.sh --fast — it is engine-free by design, read-only for the repo)?
--- OUTPUT ---
Write ONE valid JSON array to the file /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-ue-bootstrap/r1/codebase.json (full absolute path stated here — do not derive it, do not write anywhere else), then stop. Each element must match this schema exactly:
{
  "source": "codebase",
  "severity": "blocker" | "warning" | "note",
  "category": "<short tag, e.g. auth, boundary, coupling, coverage-gap>",
  "title": "<one-line summary>",
  "location": "<file:line | file:hunk | N/A>",
  "evidence": "<the exact lines you READ from the file/diff that prove the claim, pasted verbatim. Use 'N/A' ONLY for findings that have no possible code reference (e.g. a missing-spec concern). Do not paraphrase. Do not reconstruct from memory. If you cannot quote the lines, you have not done the work to file the finding.>",
  "detail": "<why this is a problem, ≤40 words>",
  "recommended_fix": "<the change to apply, ≤40 words>"
}

Output contract:
- The file /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-ue-bootstrap/r1/codebase.json must contain ONLY the JSON array. No prose, no markdown fencing, no preamble. Empty array [] is valid and expected when you find nothing.
- Do not invent findings to fill a quota.

ACCURACY MANDATE — this is the most important instruction in this prompt:

NO claim you make will be taken at face value. Every finding you emit will be independently re-verified against the actual codebase before it reaches the report. Findings that fail verification are DISCARDED SILENTLY — they will not appear in the report, you will not be asked to defend them, you get no second chance.

Therefore:
- Open the file. Read the relevant lines. Do not guess from filenames, do not assume from similar-looking code, do not generalise from one example to another.
- The `evidence` field must contain the EXACT lines you read. If you cannot paste them, you have not verified the issue and the finding does not belong in your output. A finding without locatable evidence is a hallucination — drop it before it leaves your output.
- Hedging language ("might", "could", "possibly", "potentially") is a signal that you have not actually verified the issue. Either verify it and report it crisply, or do not report it.
- Prefer fewer, well-grounded findings over many speculative ones. The user values accuracy over volume — an empty array is a fine and honest answer when nothing is wrong.
