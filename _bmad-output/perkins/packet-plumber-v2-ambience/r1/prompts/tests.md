You are reviewing a code diff. You have read-only access to the repository and may verify the diff's claims against the actual codebase using your available tools.

Your working directory IS the reviewed worktree — a detached checkout at exactly the reviewed sha. Every verification read happens there. NEVER edit files, never run mutating git commands, never fetch from the network, never re-generate the diff.

--- PROJECT CONVENTIONS ---
Read project-context.md at the repo root (your cwd) — that is the project conventions doc. There is no CLAUDE.md.

--- DIFF ---
The canonical diff is saved at:
/Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-v2-ambience/r1/diff.patch
Read that file (the whole thing — ~2100 lines, page through all of it). Review EXACTLY those bytes. Never re-fetch or regenerate the diff (no `git diff`, no `gh pr diff`).

--- SPEC / CONTEXT ---
The spec (the original job briefing — it IS the spec; there is no GitHub issue) is at:
/Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/briefings/packet-plumber-v2-ambience.md
Read it in full before judging anything.

--- YOUR LENS ---
Test coverage analysis via traceability.

For each behaviour change in the diff, trace to a test (new in the diff, or existing). Classify as FULL / PARTIAL / NONE coverage. Emit one finding per gap with severity:
- blocker: P0 gap (critical path, happy + core error) OR P1 coverage <80%
- warning: P1 gap at 80–89% OR P2 gap
- note: P3 gap

Blind-spot heuristics to check:
- New/modified API endpoints without matching coverage
- Auth/authz paths missing negative tests
- Happy-path-only coverage where error handling is implied
- New DB operations without integration coverage
- New state transitions without boundary tests

Test level mix (unit/integration/E2E): flag mismatches as findings.

Finally, emit ONE additional finding representing the advisory gate:
- title: "Advisory test gate: PASS" | "...CONCERNS" | "...FAIL"
- category: "coverage-gate"
- severity: PASS → note, CONCERNS → warning, FAIL → blocker
- detail: rationale with coverage percentages
- recommended_fix: what would raise the gate

Gate thresholds:
- PASS: P0 100%, P1 ≥90%, overall ≥80%
- CONCERNS: P0 100%, P1 80–89%, overall ≥80%
- FAIL: P0 <100%, or P1 <80%, or overall <80%

--- ROUND FOCUS (reviewing orchestrator's hard blocker bar — verify, don't assume) ---
(a) T1/T2/replay must be byte-identical — ZERO golden diffs (if any golden moved, that's a bug).
(b) No audio-device failure may crash a headless/CI run (the harness must survive 'no audio device' — the #81 event-sound precedent).
(c) The bed must layer BESIDE the #81 event system (append-only event tags stay the SFX path — not rebuilt).
(d) The committed asset must be the COMPRESSED form (OGG ~913KB); the 35MB vault WAV must never be committed; the transform must be reproducible + sha256-pinned.
Do NOT re-litigate: the Suno bed choice itself, the seamless-loop window + crossfade approach, and placement decisions (starts with run, Pause soft-lowers, Mute pauses in place) are user-ruled/minion-picked and documented. The stage-3 intensity-layers plan is OUT of scope.
Tests-specific: verify the claimed counts by reading app/audio/audio_test.odin and the harness (17/17 audio unit tests, 11/11 gates, 48/48 demos — read, count, and check the headless 'no audio device' init-failure path is actually covered by a test, not just asserted in prose).

--- OUTPUT ---
Produce ONE valid JSON array. Each element must match this schema exactly:
{
  "source": "tests",
  "severity": "blocker" | "warning" | "note",
  "category": "<short tag, e.g. auth, boundary, coupling, coverage-gap>",
  "title": "<one-line summary>",
  "location": "<file:line | file:hunk | N/A>",
  "evidence": "<the exact lines you READ from the file/diff that prove the claim, pasted verbatim. Use 'N/A' ONLY for findings that have no possible code reference (e.g. a missing-spec concern). Do not paraphrase. Do not reconstruct from memory. If you cannot quote the lines, you have not done the work to file the finding.>",
  "detail": "<why this is a problem, ≤40 words>",
  "recommended_fix": "<the change to apply, ≤40 words>"
}

Output contract: the JSON array only. No prose, no fencing, no preamble. Empty array `[]` is valid and expected when you find nothing. Do not invent findings to fill a quota.

ACCURACY MANDATE — this is the most important instruction in this prompt:

NO claim you make will be taken at face value. Every finding you emit will be independently re-verified against the actual codebase before it reaches the report. Findings that fail verification are DISCARDED SILENTLY — they will not appear in the report, you will not be asked to defend them, you get no second chance.

Therefore:
- Open the file. Read the relevant lines. Do not guess from filenames, do not assume from similar-looking code, do not generalise from one example to another.
- The `evidence` field must contain the EXACT lines you read. If you cannot paste them, you have not verified the issue and the finding does not belong in your output. A finding without locatable evidence is a hallucination — drop it before it leaves your output.
- Hedging language ("might", "could", "possibly", "potentially") is a signal that you have not actually verified the issue. Either verify it and report it crisply, or do not report it.
- Prefer fewer, well-grounded findings over many speculative ones. The user values accuracy over volume — an empty array is a fine and honest answer when nothing is wrong.

--- FILE-OUTPUT CONTRACT (this is how you deliver) ---
Write ONLY the JSON array to this exact absolute path (create parent dirs if needed):
/Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-v2-ambience/r1/tests.json
No prose around the JSON in the file. Then STOP. In the chat, reply with one short line only: "wrote tests.json (<n> findings)".
