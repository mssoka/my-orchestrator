# Lens brief — SECURITY (source: `security`) — Perkins round 1, packet-plumber-v2-spawn-feel

You are reviewing a code diff. You have read-only access to the repository and may verify the diff's claims against the actual codebase using your available tools.

--- PROJECT CONVENTIONS ---
Read /Users/moses/.herdr/worktrees/packet-plumber/perkins-packet-plumber-v2-spawn-feel-r1/project-context.md first — the project's rules for agents (Odin + raylib; pure core ODN-1; arena discipline ODN-18; save/log is binary versioned ODN-11; PP_DEBUG compile-time gates).

--- DIFF ---
Read the canonical diff (the exact change under review):
/Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-v2-spawn-feel/r1/diff.patch
The repo at /Users/moses/.herdr/worktrees/packet-plumber/perkins-packet-plumber-v2-spawn-feel-r1 is checked out at exactly the reviewed state — verify against it.

--- SPEC / CONTEXT ---
Read /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/briefings/packet-plumber-v2-spawn-feel.md (the job briefing — this IS the spec: a view-layer spawn telegraph/reveal animation for an offline single-player desktop game, plus catalog parsing folds).

--- YOUR LENS ---
OWASP-oriented security review of the diff. Identify:
- Auth/authz gaps in new endpoints, routes, or handlers
- Missing input validation at system boundaries
- Unsafe secret, token, or credential handling (leaks to logs, client responses, error pages)
- Data exposure (sensitive fields in responses, logs, or client-visible state)
- Injection vectors (SQL, XSS, command, path traversal, SSRF)
- Unsafe deserialization, insecure defaults, missing CSRF protection
- Session or cookie handling gaps

Context calibration: this is an offline single-player desktop game in Odin/raylib — there are no endpoints, sessions, or web surfaces. The realistic security-relevant surfaces in this diff are: untrusted-input parsing at the catalog boundary (`jint_strict` on balance.json keys — what happens on malformed/negative/huge values), file reads (the render test reads data/*.json from a cwd-derived path), memory safety of the raw-pointer `mem.copy` in `clone_dyn` (source/dest sizing, `size_of(T) * len`), and any debug/cheat surface in release builds. Report only real, evidenced issues — not checklist theatre for surfaces that do not exist.

--- OUTPUT ---
Return ONE valid JSON array. Each element must match this schema exactly:
{
  "source": "security",
  "severity": "blocker" | "warning" | "note",
  "category": "<short tag, e.g. memory-safety, input-validation>",
  "title": "<one-line summary>",
  "location": "<file:line | file:hunk | N/A>",
  "evidence": "<the exact lines you READ from the file/diff that prove the claim, pasted verbatim. Use 'N/A' ONLY for findings that have no possible code reference (e.g. a missing-spec concern). Do not paraphrase. Do not reconstruct from memory. If you cannot quote the lines, you have not done the work to file the finding.>",
  "detail": "<why this is a problem, ≤40 words>",
  "recommended_fix": "<the change to apply, ≤40 words>"
}

Output contract: write ONLY the JSON array (no prose, no markdown fencing, no preamble) to this EXACT absolute path:
/Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-v2-spawn-feel/r1/security.json
An empty array `[]` is valid and expected when you find nothing. Do not invent findings to fill a quota. Then stop — do not wait for input.

ACCURACY MANDATE — this is the most important instruction in this prompt:

NO claim you make will be taken at face value. Every finding you emit will be independently re-verified against the actual codebase before it reaches the report. Findings that fail verification are DISCARDED SILENTLY — they will not appear in the report, you will not be asked to defend them, you get no second chance.

Therefore:
- Open the file. Read the relevant lines. Do not guess from filenames, do not assume from similar-looking code, do not generalise from one example to another.
- The `evidence` field must contain the EXACT lines you read. If you cannot paste them, you have not verified the issue and the finding does not belong in your output. A finding without locatable evidence is a hallucination — drop it before it leaves your output.
- Hedging language ("might", "could", "possibly", "potentially") is a signal that you have not actually verified the issue. Either verify it and report it crisply, or do not report it.
- Prefer fewer, well-grounded findings over many speculative ones. The user values accuracy over volume — an empty array is a fine and honest answer when nothing is wrong.
