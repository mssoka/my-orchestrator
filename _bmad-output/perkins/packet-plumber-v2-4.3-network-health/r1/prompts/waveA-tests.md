You are reviewing a code diff. You have read-only access to the repository and may verify the diff's claims against the actual codebase using your available tools.

--- PROJECT CONVENTIONS ---
Read /Users/moses/.herdr/worktrees/packet-plumber/perkins-v2-4.3-network-health-r1/project-context.md if you need project conventions. The repo is Packet-Plumber (Odin), a sim-core + raylib-view architecture: core/ is pure sim (no I/O, integer math, deterministic per-tick hashes), app/ is the raylib presentation layer, harness/ drives demos + goldens. Golden discipline is strict: goldens are blessed artifacts; shifts must trace to documented causes.

--- DIFF ---
The diff chunk under review is at: /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-v2-4.3-network-health/r1/chunks/chunk-A-core-data.patch
Read it. It is the canonical diff for this chunk (part of PR #43, reviewed sha 8659070, base v2). The full PR diff was chunked by Perkins — you review ONLY this chunk's bytes.

--- SPEC / CONTEXT ---
Spec file: /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-v2-4.3-network-health/r1/spec-context.md — read it (job briefing + story 4.3 + arch pins [E16]/[E17]/[E30] + GDD rows + lens-guards + implementer claims).
Goldens digest (Perkins mechanical verification of the golden re-bless): /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-v2-4.3-network-health/r1/goldens-digest.md — read it.

--- YOUR LENS ---
Test coverage analysis via traceability.

For each behaviour change in the diff, trace to a test (new in the diff, or existing). Classify as FULL / PARTIAL / NONE coverage. Emit one finding per gap with severity:
- blocker: P0 gap (critical path, happy + core error) OR P1 coverage <80%
- warning: P1 gap at 80-89% OR P2 gap
- note: P3 gap

Blind-spot heuristics to check:
- New/modified API endpoints without matching coverage
- Auth/authz paths missing negative tests
- Happy-path-only coverage where error handling is implied
- New DB operations without integration coverage
- New state transitions without boundary tests

Test level mix (unit/integration/E2E): flag mismatches as findings. (The project's pins are: test_health_drain_max_not_sum_e16, test_health_drain_cap_e16, test_health_grace_lifecycle, test_health_grace_rebreach_noop_e30, test_health_grace_refill_gradual, test_health_windowed_breach_recovers, test_health_empty_run_lost_e17, test_health_surge_win_on_prepared_network, test_health_win_lose_same_tick_lose_wins, test_health_restart_clean, test_health_no_soft_lock_property — verify they exist in core/health_test.odin and actually pin the claims.)

Finally, emit ONE additional finding representing the advisory gate:
- title: "Advisory test gate: PASS" | "...CONCERNS" | "...FAIL"
- category: "coverage-gate"
- severity: PASS -> note, CONCERNS -> warning, FAIL -> blocker
- detail: rationale with coverage percentages
- recommended_fix: what would raise the gate

Gate thresholds:
- PASS: P0 100%, P1 >=90%, overall >=80%
- CONCERNS: P0 100%, P1 80-89%, overall >=80%
- FAIL: P0 <100%, or P1 <80%, or overall <80%

--- OUTPUT ---
Return ONE valid JSON array. Each element must match this schema exactly:
{
  "source": "tests",
  "severity": "blocker" | "warning" | "note",
  "category": "<short tag, e.g. auth, boundary, coupling, coverage-gap>",
  "title": "<one-line summary>",
  "location": "<file:line | file:hunk | N/A>",
  "evidence": "<the exact lines you READ from the file/diff that prove the claim, pasted verbatim. Use 'N/A' ONLY for findings that have no possible code reference (e.g. a missing-spec concern). Do not paraphrase. Do not reconstruct from memory. If you cannot quote the lines, you have not done the work to file the finding.>",
  "detail": "<why this is a problem, <=40 words>",
  "recommended_fix": "<the change to apply, <=40 words>"
}

Output contract:
- Write ONLY the JSON array to this exact file path (use your file-writing tool): /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-v2-4.3-network-health/r1/tests.chunkA.json
- Then reply with exactly one word: done
- Do not print the JSON in chat. Do not create or modify any other files. Do not fix anything.
- Empty array [] is valid and expected when you find nothing. Do not invent findings to fill a quota.

ACCURACY MANDATE — this is the most important instruction in this prompt:

NO claim you make will be taken at face value. Every finding you emit will be independently re-verified against the actual codebase before it reaches the report. Findings that fail verification are DISCARDED SILENTLY — they will not appear in the report, you will not be asked to defend them, you get no second chance.

Therefore:
- Open the file. Read the relevant lines. Do not guess from filenames, do not assume from similar-looking code, do not generalise from one example to another.
- The `evidence` field must contain the EXACT lines you read. If you cannot paste them, you have not verified the issue and the finding does not belong in your output. A finding without locatable evidence is a hallucination — drop it before it leaves your output.
- Hedging language ("might", "could", "possibly", "potentially") is a signal that you have not actually verified the issue. Either verify it and report it crisply, or do not report it.
- Prefer fewer, well-grounded findings over many speculative ones. The user values accuracy over volume — an empty array is a fine and honest answer when nothing is wrong.
