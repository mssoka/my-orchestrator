# Codebase Fit lens — packet-plumber-hud-warning-overlap-fix r1

You are reviewing a code diff. You have read-only access to the repository at the worktree `/Users/moses/.herdr/worktrees/packet-plumber/perkins-hud-warning-overlap-fix-r1` (detached at sha `b3b8ded` — verify all claims against THIS checkout, never origin) and may verify the diff's claims against the actual codebase using your available tools.

--- SPEC / CONTEXT ---
Read the shared context file at /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-hud-warning-overlap-fix/r1/prompts/common_context.md — it contains the PR scope, the acceptance criteria, the critical lens-guards, and what legitimate findings look like. It is binding for this review.

--- YOUR LENS ---
Reality check against the actual codebase. Verify by reading files, not by assuming:
- Do files, functions, types, and imports referenced in the diff actually exist and match? (`rnd.to_screen`, `draw_text`, `reject_label`, `app.drag` fields `.active/.drag_to/.valid/.wx/.wy/.cost`, `app.assist_mode`, `app.preview_live`, `app.preview.ok`, `p.ink`, `rl.Color`.)
- Are naming conventions and style consistent with the rest of the project? (Read the surrounding draw_hud code.)
- Does the diff duplicate logic that already exists elsewhere? (Point to the existing helper in `location`.)
- Are new dependencies (imports, packages) available, or do they need adding?
- Are there existing tests this diff likely breaks? (Name them in `location` — e.g. harness demos/goldens.)
- Does it leave orphan code — functions, exports, types no longer referenced after this change?

Specifically verify in the worktree:
- `rnd.to_screen`'s signature and return type — does `cur.x`/`cur.y` make sense here (the cost branch used the same access before the change)?
- The drag-state invariants: where is `app.drag.valid` set (all the invalid reasons: terminal→terminal, span-exceeds-tier, self-loop) and does the reject_label text make sense at the cursor?
- Whether any OTHER call site still draws the rejection at a fixed position (the fix must cover the only one).
- That the app still compiles cleanly at the sha (Perkins built the harness + ran the suite already; a quick `odin build` check is fine but do not thrash the repo).

--- OUTPUT ---
Write ONLY a valid JSON array to your output file: /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-hud-warning-overlap-fix/r1/codebase.json

No prose, no markdown fencing, no preamble, no trailing commentary. `[]` is valid and expected when you find nothing — do NOT invent findings to fill a quota.

Each element MUST match this schema exactly:
{
  "source": "codebase",
  "severity": "blocker" | "warning" | "note",
  "category": "<short tag, e.g. symbol-mismatch, style, duplication, orphan>",
  "title": "<one-line summary>",
  "location": "<file:line | file:hunk | N/A>",
  "evidence": "<the exact lines you READ from the file/diff that prove the claim, pasted verbatim. Use 'N/A' ONLY for findings that have no possible code reference (e.g. a missing-spec concern). Do not paraphrase. Do not reconstruct from memory. If you cannot quote the lines, you have not done the work to file the finding.>",
  "detail": "<why this is a problem, ≤40 words>",
  "recommended_fix": "<the change to apply, ≤40 words>"
}

ACCURACY MANDATE — the most important instruction: NO claim you make will be taken at face value. Every finding you emit will be independently re-verified against the actual codebase before it reaches the report. Findings that fail verification are DISCARDED SILENTLY — they will not appear in the report, you will not be asked to defend them, you get no second chance. Therefore: open the file, read the relevant lines, do not guess from filenames or assume from similar-looking code. The `evidence` field must contain the EXACT lines you read. Hedging language ("might", "could", "possibly", "potentially") is a signal that you have not actually verified the issue — either verify it and report it crisply, or do not report it. Prefer fewer, well-grounded findings over many speculative ones. Accuracy over volume — an empty array is a fine and honest answer when nothing is wrong.
