# Briefing — packet-plumber-v2-5.11-terminal-types (story 5.11 — diverse terminal types)

- **Job id:** `packet-plumber-v2-5.11-terminal-types`
- **Repo:** packet-plumber · **Base:** `v2` @ post-#65 merge head (HELD — Silas
  resolves the exact sha at release; see the hold note below) ·
  **Slug:** `v2-5.11-terminal-types`
- **HOLD (Silas):** do NOT dispatch on receipt. Release trigger = the
  `packet-plumber-terminal-assets-5.11` (#65) merge close-out — this job CONSUMES
  its approved sprite sheet + manifest. If #65's Perkins loop drags, the 5.12
  queue-swap stays your call. Record the hold on the row.
- **Model policy:** `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` (execution role). Any
  mega-minion you spawn launches with the same model — name it explicitly at
  every spawn.
- **Skills policy:** `gds-dev-story` (story execution) — the story card below IS
  the spec; `project-context.md` for code conduct. Your own adversarial pass
  uses `gds-code-review` layers (blind hunter + edge-case hunter).
- **Perkins:** `pr_review: 1` (catalog + director + growth — canon surface).
  **Loop ruling (user, 2026-08-17):** rounds run UNTIL APPROVED.
- **Memory:** read `/Users/moses/code/docs/minion-field-notes.md` at start;
  badge-out your field-notes shard per standing orders. On in-review, run
  `ledger pr packet-plumber-v2-5.11-terminal-types <url>` yourself.
- **Story card:** `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/sprints/stories-v2.md` §Story
  5.11 (relative to `/Users/moses/code/packet-plumber`). Read it + the design
  spec `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-traffic-model.md` BEFORE
  designing.
- **Assets in place:** #65 ships the lavish-APPROVED sprites (small-biz +
  campus) in the sheet + manifest, with the palcheck gate. Your job wires them
  into the GAME. The shapes are canon — do not re-render or restyle them.
- **CI:** billing-blocked GH Actions — the LOCAL suite is ground truth;
  `tools/ci-local.sh` (10 gates) must pass.

## Mission — implement story 5.11 (homes trickle, campuses flood)

**The goal:** the terminal roster gains class analogues — **residential /
small-biz / campus** — each with a different, bounded demand profile (volume,
throughput; per-terminal cap = `cap_fraction_permille × throughput ÷
packet_bandwidth`, uniform per 5.9); a campus emits far more than a home. The
terminal spectrum reads at a glance (distinct shapes — the #65 sprites).

**Hard requirements (all pinned by the card):**

1. **The CODE touch points the card names** (a new terminal role is a CODE
   change — Perkins r1 W7): the `Terminal_Role` enum gains its variants
   (`core/catalog.odin:22`) + `role_from_name` (`core/catalog.odin:1011`) + the
   `collect_terminals` role selector (`core/flow.odin`) + the growth type-pick
   (`core/growth.odin`). Name each in the PR.
2. **The catalog roster.** `node_types.json` gains the new types: per-type
   throughput/volume/cap fields (data-driven; playtest-tunable), era gating, and
   the shape mapping to the #65 sprites. Era-gated type pick for growth.
3. **Bounded, distinct demand.** Each type emits its own bounded profile
   (campus >> home in volume AND cap); the 5.9 accumulator applies uniformly.
   The director's typed source/sink selectors resolve against the new types.
4. **Growth validity.** Every spawn of a new type satisfies `[E31]` validity +
   the 5.6 placement separation; growth stays fully seed-derived
   (derive-don't-record, no log entries).
5. **Readable without color `[E9.1]`.** Distinct shape/icon per type — the
   sprites do this; assert it in a golden: **a T2 frame with ALL THREE types
   visible** (the card's named golden).
6. **Replay + goldens.** Replay byte-identical `[E10]`; catalog fold → the
   slice's deliberate T1/T2 re-bless (cause-documented, `cat.hash` proof).

**Acceptance:**

1. Card's Given/When/Then verified — the launchable reads true: homes trickle,
   campuses flood, the roster reads as a spectrum.
2. Full local suite green (`tools/ci-local.sh` 10/10); determinism pinned; the
   all-three-types T2 golden added.
3. PR body: the touch-point list (enum/selector/growth), the per-type profile
   table (throughput/volume/cap + the math), the era gating, the re-bless cause
   chain, citations `[ODN-5]` `[ODN-7]` `[E10]` `[E31]` `[E9.1]`.
4. Story card status line updated in the same PR (the established pattern).

**Scope guard:** the 5.11 wiring ONLY. No group bias (5.12), no QoS/balance
changes beyond the per-type profile data, no new sprites (the #65 set is canon),
no UI beyond what the roster needs. If a sprite gap appears (a type the sheet
doesn't cover), FLAG it — never re-render canon on your own judgment.
