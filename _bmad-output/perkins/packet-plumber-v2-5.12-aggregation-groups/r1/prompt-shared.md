You are reviewing a code diff. You have read-only access to the repository and may verify the diff's claims against the actual codebase using your available tools.

--- PROJECT CONVENTIONS ---
Read the project conventions file at:
/WORKTREE/project-context.md

--- DIFF ---
Read the canonical diff file at:
/OUTDIR/diff-code.patch
(The full PR diff also contains goldens/ binary + state-dump re-bless data that is verified mechanically by the orchestrator, not by lenses. Review exactly the code diff bytes above.)

--- WORKTREE (verify claims here) ---
/WORKTREE

--- SPEC / CONTEXT ---
Read these spec files:
- /OUTDIR/spec-briefing.md (original job briefing + the estates ruling)
- /OUTDIR/spec-story-card.md (story card 5.12 — Given/When/Then + status line)
- /OUTDIR/spec-pr-body.md (PR body — what shipped + re-bless cause chain)
- /OUTDIR/spec-perkins-guards.md (round-1 review guards — the acceptance canon)

--- YOUR LENS ---
/LENSBRIEF/

--- OUTPUT ---
Write ONE valid JSON array to this exact path (and nowhere else):
/OUTDIR//LENSNAME.json
Each element must match this schema exactly:
{
  "source": "/LENSNAME",
  "severity": "blocker" | "warning" | "note",
  "category": "<short tag, e.g. auth, boundary, coupling, coverage-gap>",
  "title": "<one-line summary>",
  "location": "<file:line | file:hunk | N/A>",
  "evidence": "<the exact lines you READ from the file/diff that prove the claim, pasted verbatim. Use 'N/A' ONLY for findings that have no possible code reference. Do not paraphrase. If you cannot quote the lines, you have not done the work to file the finding.>",
  "detail": "<why this is a problem, <=40 words>",
  "recommended_fix": "<the change to apply, <=40 words>"
}

Output contract:
- The file must contain ONLY the JSON array. No prose, no markdown fencing, no preamble.
- Empty array [] is valid and expected when you find nothing.
- Do not invent findings to fill a quota.
- After writing the file, STOP. Do not fix anything. Do not run tests that mutate state.

ACCURACY MANDATE — this is the most important instruction in this prompt:

NO claim you make will be taken at face value. Every finding you emit will be independently re-verified against the actual codebase before it reaches the report. Findings that fail verification are DISCARDED SILENTLY.

Therefore:
- Open the file. Read the relevant lines. Do not guess from filenames, do not assume from similar-looking code.
- The evidence field must contain the EXACT lines you read. A finding without locatable evidence is a hallucination — drop it.
- Hedging language ("might", "could", "possibly") is a signal you have not verified. Either verify and report crisply, or do not report.
- Prefer fewer, well-grounded findings over many speculative ones. An empty array is a fine and honest answer.
