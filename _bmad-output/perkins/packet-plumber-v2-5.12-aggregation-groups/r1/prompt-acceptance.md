You are reviewing a code diff. You have read-only access to the repository and may verify the diff's claims against the actual codebase using your available tools.

--- PROJECT CONVENTIONS ---
Read the project conventions file at:
/Users/moses/.herdr/worktrees/packet-plumber/perkins-v2-5.12-aggregation-groups-r1/project-context.md

--- DIFF ---
Read the canonical diff file at:
/Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-v2-5.12-aggregation-groups/r1/diff-code.patch
(The full PR diff also contains goldens/ binary + state-dump re-bless data that is verified mechanically by the orchestrator, not by lenses. Review exactly the code diff bytes above.)

--- WORKTREE (verify claims here) ---
/Users/moses/.herdr/worktrees/packet-plumber/perkins-v2-5.12-aggregation-groups-r1

--- SPEC / CONTEXT ---
Read these spec files:
- /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-v2-5.12-aggregation-groups/r1/spec-briefing.md (original job briefing + the estates ruling)
- /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-v2-5.12-aggregation-groups/r1/spec-story-card.md (story card 5.12 — Given/When/Then + status line)
- /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-v2-5.12-aggregation-groups/r1/spec-pr-body.md (PR body — what shipped + re-bless cause chain)
- /Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-v2-5.12-aggregation-groups/r1/spec-perkins-guards.md (round-1 review guards — the acceptance canon)

--- YOUR LENS ---
Audit the diff against the spec and context docs above. Identify:
- Violations of specific acceptance criteria
- Deviations from spec intent
- Missing implementation of specified behavior
- Contradictions between spec constraints and actual code
- Scope drift — changes not asked for by the spec

For each finding, reference the violated AC or constraint in detail (quote the exact phrase from the spec when possible).

Key spec canon for this round: the estates ruling (soft probabilistic bias, NOT 100% clustered; bias_prob_permille 750 data-driven; bias INSIDE the E31 envelope — biased candidate still faces the full E31 test; rejection sampling unchanged; uplink never forced); the derived estate view is PURE and never serialized; group-scoped demand weight 1000 + (size-1)*member_weight_permille (250) applied by MULTIPLICATION (a /1000 truncation would neutralize weight-1 terminals); the surge names the group uplink in crises.json; 5 new pins non-vacuous; the two adversarial fixes (Odin block-scoped defer use-after-free on the view; the /1000 truncation) must be in the tree.

--- OUTPUT ---
Write ONE valid JSON array to this exact path (and nowhere else):
/Users/moses/code/_bmad-output/perkins/packet-plumber-v2-5.12-aggregation-groups/r1/acceptance.json
Each element must match this schema exactly:
{
  "source": "acceptance",
  "severity": "blocker" | "warning" | "note",
  "category": "<short tag, e.g. auth, boundary, coupling, coverage-gap>",
  "title": "<one-line summary>",
  "location": "<file:line | file:hunk | N/A>",
  "evidence": "<the exact lines you READ from the file/diff that prove the claim, pasted verbatim. Use 'N/A' ONLY for findings that have no possible code reference. Do not paraphrase. If you cannot quote the lines, you have not done the work to file the finding.>",
  "detail": "<why this is a problem, <=40 words>",
  "recommended_fix": "<the change to apply, <=40 words>"
}

Output contract:
- The file must contain ONLY the JSON array. No prose, no markdown fencing, no preamble.
- Empty array [] is valid and expected when you find nothing.
- Do not invent findings to fill a quota.
- After writing the file, STOP. Do not fix anything. Do not run tests that mutate state.

ACCURACY MANDATE — this is the most important instruction in this prompt:

NO claim you make will be taken at face value. Every finding you emit will be independently re-verified against the actual codebase before it reaches the report. Findings that fail verification are DISCARDED SILENTLY.

Therefore:
- Open the file. Read the relevant lines. Do not guess from filenames, do not assume from similar-looking code.
- The evidence field must contain the EXACT lines you read. A finding without locatable evidence is a hallucination — drop it.
- Hedging language ("might", "could", "possibly") is a signal you have not verified. Either verify and report crisply, or do not report.
- Prefer fewer, well-grounded findings over many speculative ones. An empty array is a fine and honest answer.
